description: End-of-session strategic review — freeze a snapshot of session/project state before /compact so cross-session context survives compaction.
---

Run at the end of a session, immediately before `/compact`. Writes `docs/stasis.md` — the strategic microscope/macroscope that captures determinism review, security review, cross-session patterns, and memory candidates that compaction would otherwise lose.

`/stasis` is the counterpart to `/recall`: stasis writes, recall reads.

## Pre-flight halt check

1. Run `bash .ccanvil/scripts/docs-check.sh validate` and read the `.result` field.
   - **Benign states — continue:**
     - `aligned` — mid-feature, lifecycle clean
     - `missing-determinism-review` — stasis will populate the required section
     - `no-active-spec` — between features (specs/ has backlog items, none active)
     - `no docs` / missing spec+plan+stasis entirely — fresh session before any feature
   - **Corruption states — STOP and surface the failure:**
     - `stale-plan` — spec changed after plan was written
     - `mismatched` — feature_ids disagree across docs
     - `unlinked` — docs exist but have no lifecycle metadata
   - Do not write a clean stasis snapshot on top of a broken lifecycle. If halting, report the validate output and ask the user to fix the lifecycle state first.

## Data gathering (deterministic)

Collect these inputs via scripts — all deterministic, all cheap:

2. `bash .ccanvil/scripts/docs-check.sh status` — feature_id, plan_hash, content hashes for spec/plan/stasis.
3. `bash .ccanvil/scripts/docs-check.sh radar-gather` — active spec, completed specs, idea counts, roadmap theme, git activity, backlog.
4. `bash .ccanvil/scripts/docs-check.sh idea-count` — untriaged idea count for the Next Steps section.
5. `bash .ccanvil/scripts/docs-check.sh audit-session --since <last-stasis-commit>` — scan git diffs for stochastic patterns (fallback to last 20 commits if no prior stasis).
6. `bash .ccanvil/scripts/docs-check.sh legacy-refs-scan --respect-allowlist hub/tests/legacy-refs-allowlist.txt` — check for stale references to legacy verbs/artifacts, pre-filtered by the allowlist (BTS-132) so only REAL drift surfaces in Cross-Session Patterns. On downstream nodes without `hub/tests/`, omit the flag — the raw output is fine.
7. `bash .ccanvil/scripts/permissions-audit.sh check --json` (if available) — classify any DANGER or UNREVIEWED permissions. Read `.danger` count.
8. `bash .ccanvil/scripts/permissions-audit.sh promote-review --json` (BTS-149, if available) — list `settings.local.json` delta candidates classified as DELETE/TRIAGE. Read `.counts.total`.
9. `bash .ccanvil/scripts/context-budget.sh check` (if available) — context budget HEALTHY/WARNING/CRITICAL.
10. `git log --oneline -20` — recent commit history.
11. `git show HEAD~1:docs/stasis.md 2>/dev/null || true` — the prior stasis snapshot, if any. If the command fails (no prior), proceed and note "First stasis — no prior state to compare" in the Cross-Session Patterns section.

## Determine stasis kind — feature vs session

Before synthesizing, pick the stasis kind from the lifecycle state:

- **Feature-kind stasis** — write when `docs/spec.md` AND `docs/plan.md` both exist (mid-feature). Metadata carries:
  - `> Feature: <feature-id>` (from spec.md)
  - `> Work: <provider>:<id>` (inherited from spec.md's `> Work:` line; omit if spec is legacy/no Work:)
  - `> Kind: feature`
  - `> Plan hash: <plan-hash>`
- **Session-kind stasis** — write when NO active spec+plan on the current branch (typically at a session boundary on main, between features). Metadata carries:
  - `> Feature: session-YYYY-MM-DD-<short-slug>-ship`
  - `> Kind: session`
  - `> Last updated: <epoch>`
  - **NO `> Work:` field** — session-stasis is ambient state, not feature state
  - **NO `> Plan hash: <hash>`** — no plan to hash against

The validator excludes `Kind: session` stasis from feature alignment, so the old BTS-120 trap (session-stasis tripping `/pr` validate) is gone. Absence of `Kind:` defaults to feature-kind for backward-compat with pre-BTS-130 stasis files.

Inherit `> Work:` when feature-kind by reading `bash .ccanvil/scripts/docs-check.sh status` and copying `.spec.work` verbatim.

## Synthesis — write docs/stasis.md

Copy `.ccanvil/templates/stasis.md` to `docs/stasis.md` and fill each section:

### ## Accomplished
What was completed this session. Use git log + file changes as the factual spine, your own session memory for the narrative.

### ## Current State
- **Branch:** current branch
- **Tests:** result of `bash .ccanvil/scripts/bats-report.sh --parallel` (single invocation — BTS-118)
- **Uncommitted changes:** summary from `git diff --stat`
- **Build status:** clean / errors (state any failing steps)

### ## Blocked On
Anything preventing progress. "Nothing" if clean.

### ## Next Steps
Explicit numbered next actions when resuming. Pull from radar-gather's roadmap "Up Next" + spec backlog state + untriaged idea count.

### ## Context Notes
Decisions made, alternatives considered, failed approaches. Anything the next session needs to know that isn't in git history or the code itself.

### ## Determinism Review
Follow `.claude/rules/self-review.md`. Review operations from this session; flag ones that should become scripts/hooks. Fill `operations_reviewed: <count>`, `candidates_found: <count>`, plus a bullet per candidate or "No candidates this session." **This section is mandatory** — validate will flag it as missing-determinism-review if empty.

**BTS-115: dual-capture each candidate as a Linear idea.** After writing the section, for each candidate (skip entirely if `candidates_found == 0` or the resolved provider is `local`):

1. **Derive a deterministic title:** `Determinism: <candidate-slug>` where `<candidate-slug>` is the bolded operation name from the bullet (markdown `**` markers stripped, trimmed, ≤80 chars). Stable across sessions — same input, same title.
2. **Dedup against existing ideas:**
   ```bash
   IDEA_LIST=$(bash .ccanvil/scripts/operations.sh resolve idea.list --project-dir .)
   provider=$(echo "$IDEA_LIST" | jq -r '.provider')
   [[ "$provider" != "linear" ]] && continue   # local-routed: skip the capture step entirely
   listing=$(eval "$(echo "$IDEA_LIST" | jq -r '.invocation.command')")
   match=$(echo "$listing" | jq -r --arg t "$TITLE" '[.[] | select(.title == $t)] | .[0].id // ""')
   if [[ -n "$match" ]]; then
     echo "dedup: skipped '$TITLE' — existing idea $match"
     continue
   fi
   ```
3. **Capture via the BTS-166 http substrate:**
   ```bash
   RESOLUTION=$(bash .ccanvil/scripts/operations.sh resolve idea.add --project-dir .)
   cmd=$(echo "$RESOLUTION" | jq -r '.invocation.command')
   if jq -n --arg title "$TITLE" --arg description "$BODY" \
        '{title:$title, description:$description}' \
        | eval "$cmd --input-json -" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     echo "Captured idea: $TITLE"
   else
     # Pending-log fallback — replay later via /idea sync.
     bash .ccanvil/scripts/docs-check.sh idea-pending-append \
       --op add --title "$TITLE" --body "$BODY"
     echo "PENDING: capture queued for /idea sync"
   fi
   ```

The capture body is the bullet's full text (operation, what happened, deterministic replacement, impact). Capture failure NEVER aborts the stasis flow — pending-log fallback guarantees forward progress.

### ## Permissions Review Pending (BTS-149)
Conditional section — include ONLY when `(promote-review.counts.total + check.danger) > 0`. When both counts are 0, OMIT this section entirely (no noise).

When present, structure:
- One-line summary: `N DELETE/TRIAGE candidates from settings.local.json + M DANGER entries lacking accept_danger rationale.`
- Bullet list of promote-review candidates with permission + recommended decision (`DELETE one-shot`, `DELETE redundant`, `TRIAGE`).
- Bullet list of DANGER entries needing rationale (truncate at 5 with "+ N more" if >5).
- Always end with: `Run \`/permissions-review\` to triage interactively.`

### ## Cross-Session Patterns
Compare this session to the prior stasis (from step 10):
- Any determinism-review candidate that appeared last session AND this session → flag as a recurring pattern.
- Any audit-session finding that also appeared last time → flag.
- Surface any matches from `legacy-refs-scan` (step 6). Split by scope: `hub-owned` (fix at the hub) vs `node-specific` (fix in the node). If all matches are hub-owned, note "Next /ccanvil-pull will resolve."
- If `git show HEAD~1:docs/stasis.md` failed in step 10, state: "First stasis — no prior state to compare."
- If no recurring patterns found, state: "No recurring patterns."

### ## Security Review
Prefer the `security-audit` skill if available — invoke it and summarize the finding.
Fallback: grep the session's diff for secret/PII patterns (tokens, private keys, emails in non-.example files, etc.). Report `PASS` or a bullet list of findings.

### ## Memory Candidates
List insights that meet auto-memory criteria:
- Non-obvious feedback the user gave.
- Surprising project facts you learned.
- External references (Linear tickets, Slack channels, dashboards, docs).
- Patterns the user validated explicitly ("yes, exactly that").

If none: "No candidates this session."

## Commit the snapshot

12. Stage and commit `docs/stasis.md`:
    ```bash
    ALLOW_MAIN=1 git add docs/stasis.md
    ALLOW_MAIN=1 git -c commit.gpgsign=false commit -m "docs: stasis <feature-id>"
    ```
    The `ALLOW_MAIN=1` bypass is required because `protect-main.sh` otherwise blocks direct commits to main — and stasis commits are a deliberate exception (they capture state at a boundary, not feature work).

## Close

13. Final output must end with a single explicit next-action directive:
    ```
    Run `/compact` to wrap session.
    ```

## Rules

- `/stasis` is a write command. It writes exactly one file (`docs/stasis.md`), commits it, and nothing else.
- Never write a stasis on top of a non-aligned lifecycle state — halt per the pre-flight check.
- Never run `/compact` as part of stasis. Compaction is the user's next explicit action.
- Keep the synthesis tight. The stasis is a briefing, not a novel — every section should survive a cold read in the next session.
